## 1. Core Feature Ideas

| Feature Name | Description | User Value | Complexity | Innovation (1-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Conductor's Baton (Cursor)** | Custom cursor interacting with background particles. When hovering over AI nodes (Claude/Gemini/Codex), particles shift to that model's specific color (Violet/Emerald/Amber). | Immediate immersion and subtle reinforcement of the "Symphony" orchestration metaphor. | Medium | 3 |
| **Live Pipeline Visualizer** | An interactive SVG/Canvas flow chart of the 10 stages. Hovering a stage (e.g., "Research") highlights the active AI agent and shows a mock log output. | Demystifies "what happens inside the black box" and proves the structured nature of the framework. | High | 5 |
| **"Terminal Zero" Quickstart** | A hyper-realistic terminal window component that types out `npx claude-symphony` and simulates a project scaffold build in 3 seconds. | Reduces friction; shows exactly how easy it is to start. "Don't tell me, show me." | Medium | 4 |
| **The "Hand-off" Animation** | A visual loop showing a data packet moving from a Violet node (Claude) to an Emerald node (Gemini). | Visually explains "Multi-AI Collaboration" and "Context Management" without text. | Medium | 4 |
| **Bento Grid of Agents** | A grid layout showcasing the 5 Tier 1 Sub-Agents (Validation, Handoff, etc.) as "Employee Cards" with their specific speed metrics (e.g., "~15s"). | Humanizes the sub-agents and highlights the specific utility of each architectural component. | Low | 3 |
| **Code-to-Code Compare** | A slider comparing "Spaghetti Code" (Before) vs. "Symphony Orchestrated Code" (After). | Appeals to the "Architecture Review" value proposition. | Medium | 2 |
| **Infinite Scroll "Epic Cycle"** | A seamless looping background section illustrating the "Sprint Mode" and "Loop-back" features, implying continuous improvement. | Visualizes the iterative nature of software development. | Low | 3 |
| **Dynamic Tech Stack Globe** | A rotating 3D globe or cloud showing the logos of technologies the framework supports connecting to the core. | Shows extensibility and "Tech Stack Presets" capability. | High | 4 |
| **The "0% Context" Metric** | A large, animated counter that stays at "0%" for "Context Usage for Sub-Agents" while other metrics spin up. | Highlights a key technical differentiator (efficiency/cost-saving) in a bold way. | Low | 3 |
| **"Fork the Pipeline" Switch** | A toggle on the UI that splits the main visual pipeline into two paths, showing A/B testing or multi-feature development. | Visualizes the advanced "Pipeline Forking" feature for Tech Leads. | Medium | 5 |

## 2. User Personas

### 1. "Architect Aria" (The Skeptic Lead)
- **Profile:** 34, Senior Software Architect at a Series B startup.
- **Goals:** Needs to standardize how her team uses AI. Wants reproducible results, not just "magic" chat code.
- **Frustrations:** Tired of junior devs pasting broken code from ChatGPT. Worried about API costs and context window limits.
- **Tech Familiarity:** Expert. Knows Docker, K8s, CI/CD pipelines inside out.
- **Landing Page Needs:** Detailed architecture diagrams, explanation of the "Validation Agent," and clear security/privacy implications.

### 2. "Prompt-Engineer Paul" (The AI Native)
- **Profile:** 24, Full Stack Developer / Indie Hacker.
- **Goals:** Wants to build his SaaS idea *fast*. He has the vision but hates the boilerplate setup.
- **Frustrations:** Getting stuck in "loops" with AutoGPT. Managing 5 different chat windows for one project.
- **Tech Familiarity:** High. Early adopter of V0, Cursor, and Copilot.
- **Landing Page Needs:** The `npx` command, the "Sprint Mode" feature (speed), and the cool "Dark Orchestration" aesthetic.

### 3. "Open Source Oliver" (The Contributor)
- **Profile:** 29, Backend Engineer.
- **Goals:** Looking for a serious TypeScript/Python project to contribute to. Wants to learn how multi-agent systems actually work under the hood.
- **Frustrations:** AI tools that are closed source or "black boxes."
- **Tech Familiarity:** High. Checks `package.json` before reading the Readme.
- **Landing Page Needs:** Links to GitHub, clear explanation of the "10 stages," and seeing the code structure (e.g., `.claude/agents/` directory visualization).

## 3. Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Opportunity for `claude-symphony` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LangChain** | Massive ecosystem recognition; comprehensive documentation. | Can feel overwhelming/cluttered. Feels like a "library" rather than a "solution." | Position Symphony as an **opinionated framework**. You don't "build" the pipeline; you "conduct" it. |
| **AutoGPT / BabyAGI** | Viral fame; promise of full autonomy. | Known for infinite loops and getting stuck. High "toy" factor. | Emphasize **Structure & Finiteness**. The "10-stage pipeline" implies a clear start and finish, solving the "infinite loop" fear. |
| **Vercel AI SDK** | Beautiful, clean UI. Deeply integrated with Next.js. | Focuses on *building* AI apps, not *using* AI to build apps. | Differentiate by focusing on the **DevOps/Workflow** aspect. We aren't just a UI library; we are the development manager. |
| **Cursor** | Deep integration into the IDE; extremely low friction. | Single-player experience. Limited "architectural" view. | Highlight **Multi-Agent Orchestration**. Cursor helps you write a function; Symphony helps you plan and execute an Epic. |

## 4. Divergent Ideas ("The Crazy Ones")

### Idea A: "The Conductable Interface"
- **Concept:** The entire landing page is an interactive WebGL simulation. The user moves their mouse to "conduct" the music/visuals. The faster they move, the faster the "pipeline" visualizer runs.
- **Impact:** Extremely viral shareability ("Check out this site!"). High risk of usurping the actual product info, but establishes the brand as "cutting edge."

### Idea B: "The Quota Crisis" (Narrative Scroll)
- **Concept:** The site starts as a "broken" project with error logs. As you scroll, `claude-symphony` agents appear (animated) and "fix" the landing page in real-time. By the footer, the site is pristine and optimized.
- **Impact:** Purely "Show, Don't Tell." Proves the value of the "Refactoring" and "QA" stages instantly.

### Idea C: "Terminal-Only Mode"
- **Concept:** The landing page detects if the user is on desktop and defaults to a full-screen, retro-futuristic terminal. No standard HTML nav bars. Users type `help`, `features`, or `install` to navigate.
- **Impact:** Filters out non-technical users immediately (which might be good). Creates a cult following among hardcore devs. (Likely too risky for a general landing page, but could be an "Easter Egg" toggle).

## 5. Landing Page UX Flow

### The First 5 Seconds (The Hook)
1. **Visual:** A dark void. Three colored orbs (Violet, Emerald, Amber) converge to form a glowing pipeline line.
2. **Headline:** "Stop Chatting. Start Conducting."
3. **Sub-head:** "The Multi-AI Orchestration Framework that turns prompt chaos into a 10-stage symphony."

### The Emotional Journey
1. **Hero (Awe):** "This looks sci-fi and powerful. It feels like the tool Tony Stark would use."
2. **Problem Agitation (Empathy):** "Yeah, I *am* tired of copy-pasting context between 3 different AI models."
3. **Solution (Clarity):** "Oh, it handles the hand-offs for me? And it has specific stages for QA and Deployment?"
4. **Social Proof/Metrics (Trust):** "109+ automated tests? <5ms overhead? This isn't a toy."
5. **CTA (Empowerment):** "I can run this right now with one command."

### The "Keystone" Visual Element
**The "Symphony Stream":** A continuous, animated beam of light that runs vertically through the entire website.
- It changes color as it passes through different sections (Violet in the "Creative/Brainstorm" section, Amber in the "Code/Implementation" section, Emerald in the "QA/Data" section).
- It physically connects the Hero -> Features -> How it Works -> CTA, subconsciously guiding the user to the bottom.
